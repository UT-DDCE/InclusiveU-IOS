# InclusiveU-IOS

To run this project yourself, make sure you have CocoaPods installed. 

1. Clone this project
2. Run pod install to install the pods (namely google maps which needed to be excluded from this repo due to filesize restrictions)
3. Add your own iOS GoogleMaps API key to AddDelegate.m (for short term use you probably don't need one, but for long term use please get a key)
4. Open the workspace project and run!
